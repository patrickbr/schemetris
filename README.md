# SCHEMETRIS 3000 #

A tetris clone, written in scheme (http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme), a LISP dialect. Result of a university project back in 2007. I have no idea how this thing can be made to run (for old working binary, see below). I got it halfway working via the mit-scheme package for Debian, however, I cannot find image.ss and world.ss (which I remember are needed for the graphic functionality).

# Binary #

For your enjoyment, there is a schemetris.exe included in this repo which I compiled back in 2007. It should run fine with wine or on Windows.

# Usage #

Move blocks around with W-A-S-D.
